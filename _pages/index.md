The Lab for Creative Computation (CRCL) is acting at the interface of design, digital technologies and construction.

We explore new construction modes that combine robotics with human interventions and digital media, in pursuit of more creative solutions to contemporary design and construction challenges.

Showcasing scientific research and the rigour that it requires. With a playful and accessible approach to technical topics, such as programming and robotics, CRCL strives to break down the barriers for novices to enter the field.

Emphasizing and supporting the significant contributions of women in technology, as well as collaboration, open data, and open science, CRCL seeks to redefine innovation: away from conventional mentalities, and towards one that embraces collaboration, building up on current knowledge.

It is truly experimental, including the acknowledging and embracing the failures that inevitably accompany experimentation.
