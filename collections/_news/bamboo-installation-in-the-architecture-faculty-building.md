  26.09.22 -  In collaboration with GCM, ITKE and an independent artist, the CRCL unveils a lightweight bamboo structure at the heart of the Architecture faculty building. 
   BamX, a geodesic dome made from deployable bamboo cylinders, is displayed from September 22nd to 27th in the SG hall of EPFL campus. The CRCL team collaborated with the Geometric Computing Laboratory of EPFL, the ITKE Institute of Building Structures and Structural Design from the University of Stuttgart, and with Alison Martin, an independent artist, to erect this 10.4m in diameter and only 160kg computationally optimized bamboo structure.
