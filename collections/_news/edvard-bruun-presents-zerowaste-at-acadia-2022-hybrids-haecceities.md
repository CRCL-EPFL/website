  11.01.23 -  Congratulations to CRCL external advisee Edvard Bruun, who presented research on robotic dis- and reassembly of timber structures at ACADIA 2022.<br />
  <p>In collaboration with Erin Besler and the Princeton Form Finding Lab, PhD candidate and CRCL advisee Edvard Bruun presented ZeroWaste: Towards the Robotic Disassembly and Reuse of Conventional Timber Stick Frame Structures at ACADIA 2022. The project proposes a computational method of deconstructing and reassembling an existing frame structure as a means of reducing the use of new construction material. The process begins by utilizing 3D imaging technology to build a topological graph of the structural members, which represents how they are supported. This is used to generate a robotic disassembly sequence executed by multiple robotic arms for a scaffold-free dis- and reassembly. Though the paper demonstrates this process on a prototype structure, the approach is designed to be adaptable to similar structures towards rethinking material circulation and waste streams in construction.</p>
