  26.09.22 -  CRCL presented a robotic assembly prototype of reused concrete for the ENAC 20 years anniversary exhibition 
   The interdisciplinary ENAC faculty of EPFL, gathering architecture, civil engineering and environmental sciences, celebrated its 20 years. For its exhibition, CRCL showcased one of the ongoing PhD research of the lab, through a small scale robotic assembly of concrete rubbles. The research is caried by PhD candidate Maxence Grangeot, under the supervision of Prof. Dr. Stefana Parascho from CRCL and Prof. Dr. Corentin Fivet from SXL (Structural Xploration Lab). His thesis benefits expertise from both laboratories, at the intersection of structural reuse of construction waste and collaborative robotic assembly.
