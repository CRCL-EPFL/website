  23.03.23 -  Prof. Parascho was invited to give a lecture on multi-agent robotic processes at CIS. The recording is now available to <a class="notion-link-token notion-enable-hover" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TDZfLca98gY" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">watch online</a><br />
  <p>Professor Stefana Parascho gave a lecture on December 5 about the cooperative relationships between humans, robots, and the built environment. Towards expanding the role of machines beyond siloed material-specific constructions, Prof. Parascho discusses new means of information exchange and interaction that would allow for robots to be employed in more design and existing construction contexts. The lecture was part of the CIS “Get to know your neighbors” Seminar Series and is now available to <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TDZfLca98gY">watch online</a>. More information about the event and series can be found on the <a href="https://www.epfl.ch/research/domains/cis/center-for-intelligent-systems-cis/events/gtkyn/prof-stefana-parascho/">CIS website</a>.</p>
