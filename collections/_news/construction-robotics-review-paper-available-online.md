  23.03.23 -  Construction Robotics: From Automation to Collaboration by Prof. Dr. Stefana Parascho is available for download online 
   As part of Volume 6 of the Annual Review of Control, Robotics, and Autonomous Systems, the review paper Construction Robotics: From Automation to Collaboration details the evolution of robotics in architecture and construction from its first applications over 40 years ago to its critical role in complex digital assemblies today. The review focuses on field-wide trends toward more collaborative and flexible processes that would allow robots to see more widespread use in conventionally challenging environments, such as construction sites. The paper was written by Prof. Dr. Stefana Parascho and is downloadable online now in advance of final publication in May 2023.
