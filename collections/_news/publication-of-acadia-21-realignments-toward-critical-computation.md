   Following the conclusion of ACADIA 2021 ‘Realignments: Toward Critical Computation’ last year, the conference proceedings have been published as a single volume containing all of the technical papers, projects, field notes, keynote conversations, awards, and workshops from ACADIA’s 40th anniversary. The conference featured projects exploring critical computation design and fabrication across many scales and media, as well as keynote panels on topics ranging from emancipatory design to the ethics of designing with AI and data.
