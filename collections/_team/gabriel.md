Gabriel is a PhD student at CRCL and Sycamore lab. He's working on multi-agent reinforcement learning in a collaborative setting. 🦾🫂
He has obtained a bachelor's degree in micro-engineering and a master's in robotics, both at the EPFL. During his civilian service, he worked as a data analyst in aquatic ecology at EAWAG, where he used deep neural networks to predict the evolution of plankton populations. 🦠🦆
If you don't see him in the office, you could try to catch him climbing or running outside 🧗‍♂️👣, or at Unipoly, where he tries to avoid conflicts by working as a mediator. 🕊️
