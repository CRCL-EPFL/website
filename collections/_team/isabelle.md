As our new administrative specialist at CRCL, Isabelle brings her unique blend of organizational skills and adventurous spirit to every task. When she's not busy keeping the lab running like a well-oiled machine, Isabelle can be found exploring new paths, getting lost in a good book or belting out tunes at the top of her lungs in her car. Whether she's learning a new skill or perfecting a recipe, she approaches everything with enthusiasm and a can-do attitude.
