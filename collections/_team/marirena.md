Marirena is an architect, researcher, and educator with a passion for novel approaches to design and making enabled by digital technologies. Currently, she is a Postdoctoral Researcher at EPFL, jointly appointed at the Creative Computation Lab and the Structural Xploration Lab, where she investigates human-robot collaborative workflows 🤖👷‍♀️ for structural reconfiguration and reuse of damaged timber structures 🪵.
She earned her Ph.D. at ETH Zurich 🎓 in 2023 as a doctoral fellow of the Swiss National Center of Competence in Research Digital Fabrication (NCCR fab), supervised by Prof. Dillenburger. Her doctoral research focused on encapsulating all the complexity of bespoke ultralightweight spatial structures in additively manufactured connections.
When not in the lab, Marirena enjoys listening to the waves by the sea 🌊 or existing next to any form of moving water 🚣‍♀️, travelling far and away, having good coffee with friends ☕ (preferably) outside in the sun ☀️, trying out new food recipes 🍲, and making herself dirty performing all sorts of food-related alchemies 🧑‍🍳, or binge-watching movies 🎬.
