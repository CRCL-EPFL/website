After graduation, she worked in the New York office of Skidmore, Owings and Merrill for three years as a structural engineer, where she contributed to 15 projects worldwide. Notable projects she has worked on include Kempegowda International Airport Terminal II, MIT â€“ Stephen A. Schwarzman College of Computing, NYC Penn Station Entrance Canopy.
In 2021, she decided to pursue her interest in fabrication-related research. She came to Europe and did a Master of Advanced Studies in Architecture and Digital Fabrication at ETH Zurich.

In her free time, she likes walking around the city, taking photographs and watching films.
