Stefana Parascho is the Director of the Lab for Creative Computation (CRCL).

Stefana studied in Stuttgart and received her Doctorate degree from ETH Zurich, Gramazio Kohler Research. She is an Assistant Professor at EPFL and makes sure that the robots and students in the lab donâ€™t get bored. ðŸ’ƒ ðŸ¤– ðŸ•º When sheâ€™s not in the lab, she is probably in a dance class or travelling (except during pandemics). She fights to see more recognition for women in STEM fields and hopes to never get stuck on a fixed research idea.

##### Bio

Stefana Parascho is a researcher, architect, and educator whose work lies at the intersection of architecture, digital fabrication and computational design. She is currently an Assistant Professor at EPFL where she founded the Lab for Creative Computation.
Through her research, she has explored multi-robotic fabrication methods and their relationship to architectural design. Stefana investigated computational design techniques ranging from agent-based systems to sequential design and optimisation methods. Her goal is to strengthen the connection between design, structure, and fabrication, and boost the interdisciplinary nature of architecture through the development of accessible computational tools and robotic fabrication methods.
Before joining EPFL, Stefana was an Assistant Professor at Princeton University, where she led the CREATE Lab Princeton. She completed her doctorate in 2019 at ETH Zurich, Gramazio Kohler Research. Previously, she received her Diploma in Architectural Engineering from the University of Stuttgart and worked with DesignToProduction Stuttgart and Knippers Helbig Advanced Engineering.
