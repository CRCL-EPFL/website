Alexandra is a Ph.D. candidate at CRCL, working on human-robot collaboration through a lens of materiality, psychology of teamwork, and interaction design. 🤖

With a Bachelor in Engineering from McMaster University (Canada) and a Master of Science from Universität Stuttgart (ITECH Programme, Germany), Alexandra’s work intersects design, humanities, and applied science. She is interested in exploring non-standard materials enabled through emerging technologies, and is excited by the potential for collaborative robotics to challenge the status quo of the architecture-engineering-construction world! 🚀

Alexandra loves being in the mountains - whether it’s snow, grass, or rock under her board or boots 🚵‍♀️ 🏂 🏕️. She has put way too many kilometres on her commuter + weekender fun bicycle, and is in constant awe of how pretty Lausanne is!
