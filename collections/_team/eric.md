Eric is a scientific assistant at CRCL working on human interfaces and interactive installations. He studied architecture and computer science at the University of Virginia, where he discovered creative coding through Processing. 🖌 Today he bounces between visual toolkits, computer vision libraries, and robotics toward building spatial experiences and experimental applications. 🚧 Because of the unhealthy amount of time he spends staring at a monitor, he enjoys backpacking, cycling, and climbing outside of his time at the lab. 🏕
