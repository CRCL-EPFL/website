Marie-Pierre Zufferey is an architect dipl. EPFL, Doctor of Science, and scientific collaborator at CRCL. She has focused on geometry and stereotomy (stone-cutting) for a long time. Now she aims to tame robots and use them as tools that directly extend the human hand and spirit as pencil, brush, bow, and chisel toward investigating the links between representing and creating, and how to make these new technologies accessible for non-specialists.Â 

Unexepected interactions could emerge with her many outside activities, like martial arts, carving, painting, entomological and botanical observations, and reading!
