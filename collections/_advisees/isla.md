Isla is a PhD student in Architecture (Technology Track) at Princeton University . She earned her Bachelor’s Degree in Architecture and Economics from UVa and her professional Master’s Degree in Architecture from Princeton. 🍀 She’s very lucky and proud to be the very first member recruited into the CREATE Laboratory Princeton - firstly through Assistantship in Instruction for Stefana‘s course, then hired as Research Specialist II for the LightVault Project, and now as a PhD student in the lab.

When she’s not around robots 🤖, she enjoys brainstorming and collaborating with friends across disciplines for all sorts of playful projects (music, e-textile, ML and app development ... you name it). She would love to better include robots as a flexible and robust collaborator🤝with human teams in architectural design and construction settings in the near future.✨
