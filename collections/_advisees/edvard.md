Edvard Bruun is a PhD candidate in the Civil and Environmental Engineering Department at Princeton. He is co-advised by Prof. Adriaenssens (Form Finding Lab) and Prof. Parascho. He has a BASc and MASc in Structural Engineering from the University of Toronto, where he researched reinforced concrete mechanics. He performed the world’s first pure torsion tests on large-scale shell specimens (~2 tons in weight) and used the results to derive a novel finite element for the rapid analysis of reinforced concrete structures. He is also a licensed professional engineer in Ontario, where he worked for Arup in the Building Structures group before starting his PhD in 2019. In his PhD research Edvard is working on interdisciplinary topics at the intersection of structural engineering and robotic fabrication. Specifically on applying graph theoretic principles to determine stability and plan the robotic fabrication sequence for discrete element structures. The goal is to develop a fabrication-informed framework to ensure that structures are designed to be materially efficient during all steps in an assembly and disassembly sequence 🏗. In his spare time, he enjoys long walks on the beach 🏖 , listening to JJ Cale, making espressos, and operating chainsaws 🪚.
