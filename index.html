<h5><mark class="highlight-yellow">The Lab for Creative Computation</mark> - CRCL /ˈsəːkl/ - seeks to put forward non-linear construction processes that employ digital means from a human-centric perspective.</h5>

<p>We explore new construction modes that combine robotics with human interventions and digital media, in pursuit of more creative solutions to contemporary design and construction challenges.</p>

<p>We question the linear workflows traditionally present in construction that promote digital means in pursuit of automating human labor, pushing humans into low-skill work or monitoring roles. Instead, we push for new modes of interaction where humans and machines support each other, where design evolves with and during construction, and where adaptability is at the core of any process.</p>

<p>Our work targets three fundamental challenges:</p>
<ul>
<li>the climate crisis - We adapt to available materials and move away from standardized cheap but harmful ones</li>
<li>human labor - We prioritize the human experience over productivity while keeping construction efficient</li>
<li>accessibility and diversity - We strive for intuitive processes that are inclusive toward anyone who wants to engage with construction, regardless of physical abilities, gender, or background.</li>
</ul>

<p>Showcasing scientific research and the rigor that it requires, combined with a playful and accessible approach to technical topics such as programming and robotics, CRCL strives to break down the barriers for novices to enter the field. We fully embrace experimentation, acknowledging and accepting the failures that inevitably accompany it.</p>

<p>Through this work, we are building towards new interaction experiences between humans and machines, where design and engineering, digital and analog work together.</p>
