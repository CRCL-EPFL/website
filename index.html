<h5><mark>The Lab for Creative Computation (CRCL)</mark> is acting at the interface of design, digital technologies and construction.</h5>

<p>We explore new construction modes that combine robotics with human interventions and digital media, in pursuit of more creative solutions to contemporary design and construction challenges.</p>

<p>Showcasing scientific research and the rigour that it requires. With a playful and accessible approach to technical topics, such as programming and robotics, CRCL strives to break down the barriers for novices to enter the field.</p>

<p>Emphasizing and supporting the significant contributions of women in technology, as well as collaboration, open data, and open science, CRCL seeks to redefine innovation: away from conventional mentalities, and towards one that embraces collaboration, building up on current knowledge.</p>

<p>It is truly experimental, including the acknowledging and embracing the failures that inevitably accompany experimentation.</p>
